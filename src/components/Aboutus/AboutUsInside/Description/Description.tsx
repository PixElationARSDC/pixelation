        PixElation, the Photography and Videography Society of Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, Delhi University founded in 2017, is a vibrant and dynamic group of individuals who share a passion for capturing the world around them through their lenses. The society has been actively involved in various photography-related activities and events over the years. PixElation makes sure that each member of the society learns and gains something from the society, and at the same time, be a fine asset for the college. This society covers everything from creative educational sessions, retraining workshops, purpose filling trips to various competitions including exciting cash prizes. We also motivate our members to take part in competitions outside the campus and this has brought us many trophies and pride. The best time for this society is the time when it counducts it's annual fest called <b>TASVEER</b>. It is the most exciting event filled with lots of learning not only in photography but also includes lots of lessons and qualities of teamwork and friendship.
        The society also conducts various photo-walks around Delhi, so that we can explore and capture all the beauty of the state.
